            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        </center>
        <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are beings of emotion and ideas. We attempt to communicate these concepts to one another through spoken language - an imperfect medium. I have worked and studied abroad and seen how various languages can impede even very similar people from befriending each other. Even within one language, grammatical concepts and vernacular within it can indirectly influence communication. Music offers us an alternative way to share our thoughts and feelings not limited by traditional language, and every student has something to say.</p>
        <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I believe that people learn through emotional experiences, whether it be through a heartfelt and touching performance on stage or simply having fun with their peers in a classroom. To have these experiences, students must firstly be engaged. Most problems in classrooms (such as students acting up, not paying attention, and not retaining information) arise from unengaged students not given a chance to take ownership over their own learning. This involves taking requests from students about songs to learn and using the Socratic method to develop their critical thinking and analytical skills, encouraging them to connect to their lessons on a more personal level. Students are generally also much more interested in contemporary and creative uses of music, such as the modern pop band ensemble and composing for media. In classrooms, students’ eyes lit up and gave me their full attention whenever I mentioned that I had crafted soundtracks for games and combined music with technology. 
</p>
        <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who was not innately musically talented and had struggled with the aural aspects of mastering music, I understand how people can excel in certain areas but become discouraged in others due to their natural aptitudes. Fortunately, music is a fantastic way to actively both appeal to the left and right brains, so there are many different approaches to learning I employ to capitalize on engaging different types of learners. Some students might love rehearsing and performing music - the traditional way music is generally thought to be taught in schools. But others may have an affinity for creativity through improvisation and composing. Regardless of their strengths and weaknesses, scaffolding the lessons is imperative. There must be room to simultaneously allow a struggling student time to learn while excelling students have space to grow. “Make your weaknesses your strengths, and your strengths stronger.”
</p>
     
        <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For music, a combination of both formal and informal assessment must be employed. My top priority is housing an environment where the students are free to express themselves, and too obvious and frequent formal assessment will hinder their desire to be creative and outgoing (especially for introverts who may struggle in certain expressive musical aspects). To counterbalance this, I also informally assess how students may learn over the entire unit based off of their participation and mastery of the application of their knowledge.
</p>
        <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have formal training in not just musical education, but also modern technology; graphic design, videography, programming, website design, business technology, communications, user experience, 3D modelling, virtual reality and 360 video are all within my realm of expertise. In my teaching I strive to utilize these as much as possible to actively engage my modern, technologically inclined students so that each day will be new and magical - no two lessons will be the same. This also fosters a modern, inclusive, and adaptable environment where I can tweak my lessons to allow those with learning disabilities an equal chance to participate.
