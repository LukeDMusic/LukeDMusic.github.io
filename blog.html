            <h2>Interdisciplinary Music Teaching</h2>
        </center>
        
        <center><img id="blog1" src="images/child.jpg" width="5%"></center>

        <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently began this semester's observation hours at a nearby elementary school. During my time there, I witnessed the third grade class doing a unit about taking a "world tour" around the world. Each student had small paper booklets that served as their passports, and each class they would visit a new location and add a sticker from the area of the day. As students would ask to go to the bathroom, the teacher would respond, "Hurry back so you don't miss our tour of Ireland!" This is not only a great way to present world music in an exciting way, but also a great way to accomplish interdisciplinary music teaching.</p>
        
        <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world music lesson began after they had warmed up with a beginning song. However, before they actually began to sing the location's song they first learned about the country's music, instruments, flag, food, history, location, and culture in general. This helps engage the students, and the teacher encouraged hearing about students' personal connections to the country of focus. Interdisciplinary music teaching is easiest to do a the "in" to a lesson, like a funnel - wide on top, small on bottom. Through starting wide, learners will become more invested because they have a reason to be invested in the learning. We have all heard people say in math class, "When will I ever need this?" Starting wide is a perfect way to explain when and why you might care.</p>

            </center>

            <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This semester, I am observing both elementary and middle school general music classes as well as their choirs. Of course, there are more problematic classes than others. In elementary, it is the fourth grade; in middle, the seventh grade. They each have class policies and reward systems in place to preemptively stop these situations, but still have also utilized different approaches to reprimanding their students, to differing effects.</p>

            <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fourth grade, the teacher maintains her usual upbeat tone of voice and does not raise it. At the end of the period, she asks the students to rate their personal participation on a scale from 1 to 5 by raising fingers. This is not part of any bigger reward or punishment system, but is still effective because it puts the onus on the student to self-evaluate and be responsible for themselves.</p>
        
            <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In seventh grade, with the students being older and in a sense more stubborn, the teacher must raise her voice frequently towards the problem students. It ends up costing much of the lesson time in order to keep them in check. However, she remains hesitant to fully punish them or separate their seating arrangement - most likely out of a personal disdain for doing so.</p>

            <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to exactly compare the elementary and middle school teacherâ€™s methods exactly because as children age they may respond to punishment differently. At least in my limited opinion, I would prefer to always be very nice but stern in my punishment. If I wait too long to instill an actual punishment or seating change, then the students will feel that they can get away with too much, which will inevitably result in me having to stop class to lecture them on their behavior and be angry when they continue to be a disruption. At the end of the day, I consider it important to follow up via private conversation about why they are disrupting class - is it because the lesson is not entertaining enough? Do they not feel like they have agency in their learning?</p>

            <p class="articlepara">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For both classes, this is obviously unfortunate for the children who are doing a great job and must suffer along with the problematic ones. In cases such as these, the class-wide reward systems must be tailored so that the individual students still get recognized (in addition to repeatedly mentioning that the teacher is not upset at everyone in the class, and thanking the well-behaved students).</p>
